.SH NAME
igb \-This file describes the Linux* Base Driver for the Gigabit Family of Adapters.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PD 0.4v
modprobe igb [<option>=<VAL1>,<VAL2>,...]
.PD 1v
.SH DESCRIPTION
This driver is intended for \fB2.4.x\fR and \fB2.6.x\fR kernels.  This driver includes support for Intel(R) Itanium(R)2-based systems.
.LP
This driver is only supported as a loadable module at this time.  Intel is not supplying patches against the kernel source toallow for static linking of the driver.  For questions related to hardware requirements, refer to the documentation supplied with your Intel adapter.  All hardware requirements listed apply to use with Linux.
.SH OPTIONS
The following optional parameters are used by entering them on the command line with the modprobe command.  
For example:
.IP
modprobe igb InterruptThrottleRate=16000,16000
.IP
.B InterruptThrottleRate
.IP
.B Valid Range: 
0,1,3,100-100000 (0=off, 1=dynamic, 3=dynamic conservative)
.IP
.B Default Value: 
3
This represents the maximum number of interrupts per second the controller generates.  InterruptThrottleRate is another setting used in interrupt moderation.  Dynamic mode uses a heuristic algorithm to adjust InterruptThrottleRate based on the current traffic load.
.IP
The default setting is configured to optimize interrupts for bulk 
throughput while keeping CPU utilization low.  However this setting may 
result in slower overall transfer speeds if network traffic consists 
mostly of small packets.  If this is the case, change this value to 0. 
.IP
Un-supported Adapters: InterruptThrottleRate is NOT supported by 82542, 82543 or 82544-based adapters.
.IP
.B NOTE: 
InterruptThrottleRate takes precedence over the TxAbsIntDelay and RxAbsIntDelay parameters.  Inother words, minimizing the receive and/or transmit absolute delays does not force the controller to generate more interrupts than what the Interrupt Throttle Rate allows.
.IP
See the section "InterruptThrottleRate" in README.
.IP
.B LLIPort
.IP
.B Valid Range:
0-65535 (0=off)
.IP
.B Default Value:
0
.IP
LLI is configured with the LLIPort command-line parameter, which specifies which TCP port should generate Low Latency Interrupts.
.IP
For example, using LLIPort=80 would cause the board to generate an immediate interrupt upon receipt of any packet sent to TCPport 80 on the local machine.
.IP
.B LLIPush
.IP
.B Valid Range:
0-1 (0=off)
.IP
.B Default Value:
0
.IP
Can be set to be enabled or disabled (default). It is most effective in an environment with many small transactions.
.IP
NOTE: Enabling LLIPush may allow a denial of service attack.
.IP
.B LLISize
.IP
.B Valid Range:
0-1500 (0=off)
.IP
.B Default Value:
0
.IP
Causes an immediate interrupt if the board receives a packet smaller than the specified size. 
.IP
.B IntMode
.IP
.B Valid Range:    
0-3
.IP
.B Default Value:
2
.IP
0 - Legacy Interrupts, single queue
1 - MSI interrupts, single queue
2 - MSI-X interrupts, single queue (default)
3 - MSI-X interrupts, multiple queues
.IP
Allows changing interrupt mode and MQ status at load time, without requiring
a recompile. If the driver fails to enable a specific interrupt mode, it will
fail back to lesser capabilities.
.SH JUMBO FRAMES
Jumbo Frames support is enabled by changing the MTU to a value larger than the default of 1500.Use the ifconfig command to increase the MTU size.  For example:
.IP
ifconfig ethx mtu 9000 up
.LP
.B NOTE: 
Jumbo Frames are supported at 1000 Mbps only.  Using Jumbo Frames at 10 or 100 Mbps may result in poor performance or loss of link.
.LP
Some Intel gigabit adapters that support Jumbo Frames have a frame size limit of 9238 bytes, with a corresponding MTU size limit of 9216 bytes. 
.LP
See the section "Jumbo Frames" in README.
.SH Ethtool
The driver utilizes the ethtool interface for driver configuration and diagnostics, as well as displaying statistical information.  Ethtool version 1.8.1 or later is required for this functionality.
.LP
The latest release of ethtool can be found from http://sf.net/projects/gkernel.  The driver then must be recompiled in order to take advantage of the latest ethtool features.
.LP
Ethtool 1.6 only supports a limited set of ethtool options.  Support for a more complete ethtool feature set can be enabled by upgrading ethtool to ethtool-1.8.1.  
.SH SUPPORT
